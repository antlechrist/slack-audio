alsa-tools-usx2y (Tools for Tascam usx2y devices)

This package contains us428control and usx2yloader for Tascam
US-428, US-224, and US-122 USB devices. This does not install
all of the tools contained in the source tarball.

Copy 55-tascam-usx2y.rules.def to 55-tascam-usx2y.rules and
edit according to which device you have. (The default is US-428.)

You probably want the alsa-firmware package as well.
